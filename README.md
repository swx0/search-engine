# Web Search Engine
## About
A **search engine** is a software system that is designed to carry out web searches (Internet searches), which means to search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query. 
The 3 primary functions of a search engine include:
- **Crawling** the web
- **Indexing** the results
- **Query processing**

Modern search engines would make use of a wide variety of heuristics(Quality Score etc.) for ranking the search results, in order for the more relevant search results to appear earlier than others.
